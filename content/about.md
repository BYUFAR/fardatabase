> ## "Given the widespread public acceptance of the conflict model, it comes as a surprise to many that *no historians will support it.* Let me be clear, the idea that scientific and religious camps have historically been separate and antagonistic is rejected by all modern historians of science."

-- *Dr. Lawrence M. Principe, Drew Professor of the Humanities at Johns Hopkins University, in* [Science and Religion, Lecture 2](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/science-and-religion) *(emphasis added)*

The Faith and Reason database is *not* intended to be a list of arguments, answers, and responses similar to those that FAIR or the B. H. Roberts Foundation's excellent [mormonr.org](https://mormonr.org) site provide. Instead, the Database team intends to present an organized index of mainly academic resources(avoiding podcasts, YouTube videos, and similar where possible) relating to fields such as Mormon studies, the philosophy of religion, cognitive/social science of religion, and other areas of conflict. The areas of interest are far-reaching and our coverage is far from comprehensive.
